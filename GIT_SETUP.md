# Getting Your Project Code from Firebase Studio to Your Local Computer

This guide provides a step-by-step process to take your project from the Firebase Studio environment, save it to a GitHub repository, and then download (clone) it to your local computer.

---

## Part A: Push Your Code from Firebase Studio to GitHub

This part is done entirely within the Firebase Studio environment.

### Step 1: Open the Terminal in Firebase Studio
Find and open the built-in terminal or command-line interface within Firebase Studio. This will be your workspace for running Git commands.

### Step 2: Initialize a Local Git Repository
First, check if your project is already a Git repository.
```bash
git status
```
*   If it says "fatal: not a git repository", you need to initialize one. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
*   If it lists files or says "nothing to commit", Git is already initialized. You can proceed to the next step.

### Step 3: Add and Commit Your Files
Add all your project files to the Git repository and create a "commit," which is a snapshot of your code.
```bash
# Add all files to be tracked
git add .

# Create the first commit with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit of Edutalks project"
```

### Step 4: Create an Empty Repository on GitHub.com
1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.
2.  Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **"New repository"**.
3.  **Repository name:** Give it a name (e.g., `edutalks-app`).
4.  **Description (optional):** A brief description of your project.
5.  **Public or Private:** Choose the visibility of your repository.
6.  **IMPORTANT:** **Do NOT** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license` file. You need an empty repository to push your existing project into.
7.  Click **"Create repository"**.

### Step 5: Link Your Firebase Studio Project to GitHub
1.  On the new GitHub repository page, copy the **HTTPS URL**. It will look like this:
    `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git`
2.  Back in the Firebase Studio terminal, link your local project to the GitHub repository.

    First, ensure there isn't an old link. Run:
    ```bash
    git remote remove origin
    ```
    (It's okay if this command shows an error saying "No such remote").

    Now, add the correct link:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    ```
    (Replace the URL with the one you copied).
3.  It's good practice to ensure your main branch is named `main`:
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```

### Step 6: Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub
GitHub requires a Personal Access Token instead of your regular password for command-line operations.
1.  Go to your GitHub **Settings** -> **Developer settings** -> **Personal access tokens** -> **Tokens (classic)**.
2.  Click **"Generate new token"** (select "Generate new token (classic)").
3.  **Note:** Give the token a name, like `Firebase-Studio-Access`.
4.  **Expiration:** Set an expiration date (e.g., 30 or 90 days).
5.  **Scopes:** Check the box for **`repo`**. This is the most important step, as it grants permission to push code.
6.  Click **"Generate token"**.
7.  **Copy the token immediately.** You will not see it again. Treat it like a password.

### Step 7: Push Your Code to GitHub (The Upload Step)
Now, push your committed files from Firebase Studio to GitHub. **This is the step that actually uploads your code.**
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
*   **Git will prompt for your username and password.**
    *   **Username:** Enter your GitHub username (e.g., `tharun-a11y`).
    *   **Password:** **Paste your Personal Access Token (PAT)** that you just copied. Do NOT use your regular GitHub password.

If successful, you will see output like this:
```
Enumerating objects: ..., done.
Counting objects: 100% (...), done.
...
To https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```
**Now, refresh your GitHub repository page in your browser. Your files should be visible.**

### Troubleshooting
*   **Error: `repository not found` or `Authentication failed`**:
    *   This almost always means your **Personal Access Token (PAT)** is wrong, has expired, or doesn't have the correct `repo` scope.
    *   Go back to GitHub and generate a new PAT, making sure to copy it correctly and check the `repo` scope.
*   **Error: `src refspec main does not match any`**:
    *   This means your main branch might be named `master`. Try running `git push -u origin master` instead.
*   **Error: `remote origin already exists`**:
    *   Run `git remote remove origin` and then re-run the `git remote add origin ...` command from Step 5.

## Part B: Download (Clone) Your Code from GitHub to Your Local Computer

This part is done on your personal computer (laptop or desktop) **after you can see your files on GitHub.com**.

### Step 1: Install Git on Your Local Computer
If you don't already have Git installed, download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### Step 2: Open a Terminal or Command Prompt on Your Local Computer
*   **Windows:** Open Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash.
*   **Mac/Linux:** Open the Terminal app.

### Step 3: Navigate to Where You Want to Store the Project
Use the `cd` (change directory) command to go to the folder where you want to download your project.
```bash
# Example: Navigating to your Desktop
cd Desktop
```

### Step 4: Clone the Repository from GitHub
1.  Go to your repository on GitHub.com.
2.  Click the green **"< > Code"** button.
3.  Make sure the **HTTPS** tab is selected, and copy the URL.
4.  In your local terminal, run the `git clone` command with the URL you just copied:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    ```
    (Replace the URL with your repository's URL).

This command will create a new folder with your repository's name and download all the project files into it.

### Step 5: Open the Project and Install Dependencies
1.  Navigate into the newly created project folder:
    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```
2.  Install all the necessary project packages by running:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

You now have a complete copy of your project running on your local computer!
