// This custom service worker file was part of an initial PWA setup.
// It is no longer needed as `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` now generates and manages
// the service worker automatically during the build process.
//
// You can safely delete this file (public/sw.js).
// `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` will create its own service worker files (e.g., sw.js, workbox-*.js)
// in the 'public' directory when you build the application.
